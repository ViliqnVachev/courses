                    <br>
                    <p>The United States of America (USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S.) or America, is a
                        federal republic composed of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing
                        territories, and various possessions. At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2) and
                        with over 325 million people, the United States is the world's third- or fourth-largest country
                        by total area and the third-most populous country as well as the largest
                        Christian-majority country. The capital is Washington, D.C., and the largest city by population
                        is New York City. Forty-eight states and the capital's federal district are contiguous and
                        located in North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in the northwest
                        corner of North America, bordered by Canada to the east and across the Bering Strait from Russia
                        to the west. The state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The U.S.
                        territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, stretching across nine
                        official time zones. The extremely diverse geography, climate, and wildlife of the United States
                        make it one of the world's 17 megadiverse countries.
                        Paleo-Indians migrated from Asia to the North American mainland at least 15,000 years ago.
                        European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the thirteen
                        British colonies established along the East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and
                        the colonies following the French and Indian War led to the American Revolution, which began in
                        1775, and the subsequent Declaration of Independence in 1776. The war ended in 1783 with the
                        United States becoming the first country to gain independence from a European power. The
                        current constitution was adopted in 1788, with the first ten amendments, collectively named the
                        Bill of Rights, being ratified in 1791 to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties. The United
                        States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century,
                        acquiring new territories, displacing Native American tribes, and gradually admitting new
                        states until it spanned the continent by 1848. During the second half of the 19th century,
                        the Civil War led to the abolition of slavery. By the end of the century, the United
                        States had extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy, driven in large part by the
                        Industrial Revolution, began to soar. The Spanishâ€“American War and World War I confirmed the
                        country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a
                        global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in
                        warfare, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. During the Cold War, the
                        United States and the Soviet Union competed in the Space Race, culminating with the 1969 moon
                        landing. The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United
                        States as the world's sole superpower.
                        The United States is a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary
                        Fund, Organization of American States (OAS), and other international organizations. The United
                        States is a highly developed country, with the world's largest economy by nominal GDP and
                        second-largest economy by PPP, accounting for approximately a quarter of global GDP. The
                        U.S. economy is largely post-industrial, characterized by the dominance of services and
                        knowledge-based activities, although the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the
                        world. Though its population is only 4.3% of the world total, the U.S. holds 33.4% of
                        the total wealth in the world, the largest share of global wealth concentrated in a single
                        country. The United States ranks among the highest nations in several measures of
                        socioeconomic performance, including average wage, human development, per capita GDP, and
                        productivity per person. The U.S. is the foremost military power in the world, making up a
                        third of global military spending, and is a leading political, cultural, and scientific
                        force internationally.</p>
